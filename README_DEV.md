# CreAleph DEV Mode

CreAleph is an Intelligence & Execution OS. It turns market signals into execution-ready
structures for ads, SEO, landing pages, and content pipelines. Sites, ads, and SEO are
outputs of the system, not the core product.

## DEV Mode behavior

- A DEV login bypass exists only for local testing when the database is offline.
- In DEV Mode, the app returns in-memory mock data to keep flows functional.
- A real database is required for production use.

## What works without a database

- Robot creation returns a temporary in-memory robot.
- Competitors, insights, fusion, and playbooks v2 return mock structured data.
- Sessions still work with the DEV login for local testing.
